The project is titled " Design of an Advanced Vehicle Safety System to Minimize Nationwide Accidents" which is my final year project to fulfil my bachelors degree in mechatronics.

The main objectives of the project are:

1. Develop an accurate image processing model to detect driver drowsiness and fatigue.
2. Design a sensor-based system to detect alcohol levels in real-time and identify objects near the vehicle.
3. Implement an automated mechanism to engage the brake pedal in scenarios like exceeding the legal alcohol limit, detecting driver drowsiness, and impending collisions.
4. Integrate an alarm system to alert the driver during emergencies.

The rationale behind the project is the urgent need to mitigate road accidents and fatalities in Zimbabwe by actively monitoring driver impairment. The proposed system aims to prevent unfit drivers from operating their vehicles, addressing human error which is a leading cause of accidents.

The key contributions of the project include:

1. Adoption of an accurate hybrid monitoring system combining image processing and sensor-based detection.
2. Implementation of an emergency braking mechanism to automatically engage the brakes in hazardous situations.

The project aims to provide affordable safety features typically found only in high-end vehicles to all vehicle owners in Zimbabwe, potentially reducing insurance costs, healthcare costs, and improving overall productivity.
